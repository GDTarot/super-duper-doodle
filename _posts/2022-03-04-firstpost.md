# A Blog Post for Toptal

  A great deal of what I have contributed to projects over the years has been quite short-term, and it is a little overwhelming to read so many decriptions by Toptal talent of contributions that have been long term, with major companies, have saved millions of dollars, cut time frames in half, resulted in tripled revenues, and so forth. Obviously, I have enough experience to realize that these results came not just from the effort of one individual, but the coupling of their leadership with an effective <i>team</i>.
  
  Leadership is the key. I do have an example of a long-term "project" where my leadership and technical knowledge made a real difference:
  
  As academic dean of a mid-size family-owned and -operated proprietary college, I was immediately confronted with a math problem. The Dean's List did not make sense. Following some calculations, I observed, documented, and altered the examination system to eliminate security weaknesses, resulting in a 100% reduction in cheating (and a lot of unhappy former Dean's List students). Working with the IT contractor, and updating a lot of the testing software by hand, I fixed that problem.
  
  Then, I worked with the Registrar to harden the software where grades were recorded, stored and accessed. We ended up with a secure and reliable system.
  
  Further, I implemented an open-source classroom management system (Moodle) for the use of the 25 faculty members (not everyone used it, but they had the option).
  
  To shine a light on my interpretive and writing skills, I wrote the entire accreditation self-review for the college president; this was a major undertaking that resulted in the college's first accreditation review with no findings, and that is a big deal.
  
  In education, you learn a lot, because you have to in order to be a good educator. One profile I really found interesting on Toptal was that of <a href="http://toptal.com/project-managers/resume/donna-penick#ProjectHistory" Donna Pennick</a>. As a top Project Manager, coming (as I do) from an education background, she is killing it from all angles. I notice that she also acquired Scrum Master certification, as I have, but she has a lot more than that going on. Donna seems like a cool person and I would like to meet her one day. It is always interesting to connect with others who have a background in education and an interest in technology. Admittedly, I am not as far along my path as she is, but I know that, as always, opportunities will come and I will rise to meet them.
